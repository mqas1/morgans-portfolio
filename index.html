                <p>I am currently enrolled in the joint edX and University of Sydney web development boot camp. 
                    My academic background is in philosphy and history having completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Sydney.<br>
                    <br>Music is one of my passions, both its reproduction and in playing it. I play the drums and guitar.</br>
                    <br>I find that web development allows me to showcase these aspects of my personality. It is a great medium to channel one's creativity whether starting fresh with a blank canvas or adding to an existing codebase.</br>
                    <br>Web development allows me to utilise the problem solving and critical thinking skills that I honed as an undergraduate.</br>
